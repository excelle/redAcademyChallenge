# redAcademyChallenge

To recreate the file http://excelle.github.io/redAcademyChallenge/red-landing.jpg

I sed HTML & CSS, focused on flexbox

**Challenges:**
- I haven't used numeric font-weight before (Assuming I am supposed to only use numeric as per the Typography specifications)
- Can't duplicate the actual RED Academy logo font-weight
- Didn't start with CSS Reset and when I added up later on, it actually did reset a lot so I decided to not use it at all.
- Position was just used for the grey border between sections

**Re: Git/Github**
- I used a different tool to download and commit (TortoiseSVN)
